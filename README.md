# Sentiment Analysis using Yelp Reviews
## Overview
This project was completed during the first semester of my final year (December 2023). The primary goal was to perform sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews using machine learning techniques. My role involved data analysis, data cleaning, and developing machine learning models to classify sentiments.

# Responsibilities
- Data Analysis & Cleaning: Cleaned and preprocessed the Yelp review data, which included removing stop words, converting text to lowercase, and filtering out non-English words. Additionally, I refined the dataset by handling neutral reviews (e.g., converting 3-star reviews to 0 and 4-5 stars to 1) to streamline the classification process.
- Machine Learning Models: Developed and fine-tuned machine learning models, including:
  - Logistic Regression: Efficiently modeled binary classification tasks, leveraging its simplicity and ability to handle large datasets.
  - DecisionTreeClassifier: Captured complex relationships within the data, handling various data types and missing values effectively.
# Tools & Technologies
- Machine Learning Libraries: Used scikit-learn to implement and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.
- Data Processing: Utilized PySpark for scalable data processing and cleaning.
# Future Work
- Expanding the range of models by incorporating Random Forest, K-Means, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Exploring Neural Networks with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for more advanced sentiment analysis.
- Evaluating the models on external datasets to test generalizability.
